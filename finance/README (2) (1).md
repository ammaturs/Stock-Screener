# FINANCE
#### DESCRIPTION:

Finance was another assignment I worked on in CS50's: Introduction to Computer Science where I Implemented a website via which users can “buy” and “sell” stocks.
The website contained a homepage, buy, sell, quote and history pages, stored all personal user data in a database which could store the information, buy and sell history of multiple different users.
